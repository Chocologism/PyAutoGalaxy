Galaxies
========

Nearly a century ago, Edwin Hubble famously classified galaxies into three distinct groups: ellipticals, spirals and
irregulars. Today, by analysing millions of galaxies with advanced image processing techniques Astronomers have
expanded on this picture and revealed the rich diversity of galaxy morphology both in the nearby and distant
Universe.

``PyAutoGalaxy`` is an open-source Python package for the multi-wavelength analysis of the morphologies of large
galaxy samples.

To use **PyAutoGalaxy** we first import autogalaxy and the plot module.

```py
   import autogalaxy as al
   import autogalaxy.plot as aplt
```
