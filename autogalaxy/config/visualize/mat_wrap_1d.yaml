# These settings specify the default matplotlib settings when 1D figures and subplots are plotted.

# For example, the `EinsteinRadiusAXVLine` section has the following lines:

# EinsteinRadiusAXVLine:
#    figure:
#      c: b
#    subplot:
#      c: b

# This means that when a figure of y vs x data is plotted it will use `c=k`, meaning the line appears blue,
# provided the values of these parameters are not manually set by the user via a `MatPlot1D` object.
#
# In the above example, subplots (e.g. more than one image) will always use `c=b` by default as well.
#
# These configuration options can be customized such that the appearance of figures and subplots for a user is
# optimal for your computer set up.

EinsteinRadiusAXVLine:              # wrapper for `plt.axvline()`: customize verticals lines plotted to represent the Einstein radius on 1D figures.
  figure:
    c: b
    linestyle: --
  subplot:
    c: b
    linestyle: --
HalfLightRadiusAXVLine:             # wrapper for `plt.axvline()`: customize verticals lines plotted to represent the half-light radius on 1D figures.
  figure:
    c: g
    linestyle: -.
  subplot:
    c: kg
    linestyle: -.
ModelFluxesYXScatter:               # wrapper for `plt.scatter()`: customize 1D plot of fluxes for point-source modeling.
  figure:
    c: c
  subplot:
    c: c
